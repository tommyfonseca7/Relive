# Relive

Relive is a kotlin based android app that helps sports enthusiastics capture their moments and share them with their group of friends. 
It uses the [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/) API to get the matches and stats. The backend of the app is hosted on firebase.

This application was developed for a final project for the Mobile and Ubiquous Computation Class in the Master's of Computer Science at Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa.
